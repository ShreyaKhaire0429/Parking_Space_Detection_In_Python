# Parking_Space_Detection_In_Python
**Parking Space Detection in Python** is a computer vision project that detects and highlights available parking spots using OpenCV. It processes video or image inputs to identify occupied and vacant spaces efficiently. Ideal for smart parking solutions, this project enhances parking management automation. ðŸš—ðŸ“¸

Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to develop a computer vision application that counts the number of available parking spaces in a video. The system processes video frames, analyzes the parking spaces, and displays the count of free and occupied spots.
